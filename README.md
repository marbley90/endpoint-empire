# RESTFUL API PROJECT USING SEQUELIZE ORM

### Project Overview

This project implements a RESTful API built using NestJS with Express as the underlying HTTP server. The API is designed to manage client-professional interactions, specifically jobs and contracts, with a focus on performance and extensibility. Here's a breakdown of the key features and decisions made during development:

### Key Technologies Used

    NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
    Sequelize ORM: Used for interacting with the database, providing a robust abstraction layer for defining models, associations, and complex queries.
    Caching Mechanism: To reduce database round trips for frequently accessed data, a cache layer is implemented. Cached responses are invalidated after a short time (1 hour) to ensure freshness.

### Features

    Endpoints with Swagger Documentation:
        Swagger was integrated to serve as both API documentation and a tool for testing endpoints.
        This eliminates the need for a traditional frontend during development or testing phases, allowing developers and stakeholders to interact with the API seamlessly.

    Caching Implementation:
        To optimize performance, a caching mechanism is used to store the results of certain endpoints.
        For instance, queries that retrieve unpaid jobs or high-cost clients are cached, avoiding repeated database hits when called frequently.
    
    Seeding Script:
        A seeding script (seed) is provided for populating the database with initial test data.
        This script uses Sequelize to define models, sync tables, and insert predefined data into the database.
        The script can be executed with the command: npm run seed

    Testing:
        Unit tests are implemented to ensure that core logic functions correctly.
        Due to time constraints, end-to-end (E2E) tests are not included but are recommended for future iterations.

    Configuration Management:
        Some configuration values, such as Redis cache configuration, are currently hardcoded.
        A better approach would be to use environment variables loaded from a .env file for easier deployment and flexibility.

### Areas for Improvement

    Hardcoded Configurations:
        Move Redis and other critical configurations (e.g., database credentials) to a .env file for better security and portability.

    E2E Testing:
        Adding end-to-end tests would provide greater confidence in the API's reliability, especially in multi-layered integration scenarios.

    Error Handling and Logging:
        While basic error handling is in place, a more sophisticated logging system (e.g., Winston or Pino) could be added to monitor performance and detect issues in production.

### How to Use

    Installation:
        Run npm install to install dependencies.

### Database Seeding:

    Populate the database with predefined test data using the command:

    npm run seed

### Running the Application:

    Start the development server: npm run start
    Access the Swagger documentation at http://localhost:3001/api.

### Testing:

    Run unit tests using: npm test
